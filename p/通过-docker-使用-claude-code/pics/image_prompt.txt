图片描述:
A stylized, dark-themed illustration depicting a Docker container labeled "claude-code" with its terminal window prominently displayed.  The terminal shows a simplified representation of the provided Docker run command, highlighting key parameters like `-v`, `-e`, and the image name.  The container is connected via lines to a stylized representation of an older server system (slightly faded and less modern in design) and a modern, sleek laptop representing the user's machine.  The overall color scheme is predominantly dark gray and blue, with subtle highlights on the Docker container and laptop to emphasize their importance.  The background is a minimalist dark gray gradient. The laptop screen shows a partially visible code editor with syntax highlighting.
