图片描述:
A split-screen illustration.  The left side shows a terminal window displaying a markdown file with code syntax highlighting.  The right side shows a modern web browser displaying the same content rendered as clean, responsive HTML.  A subtle animation suggests the HTML updates in real-time as the markdown file is edited on the left.  The overall color scheme is dark, with a muted teal accent highlighting the real-time update process.  The illustration uses clean, flat vector graphics, with a minimalist and professional aesthetic.
